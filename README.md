OPTIMIND is an adaptive, low-latency, and memory-efficient brain–computer interface (BCI) architecture designed for real-time EEG-based emotion recognition under strict power and hardware constraints. The system exploits emotion-induced neural variability as a control signal rather than treating it as noise, enabling efficient online learning with minimal non-volatile memory (NVM) overhead.

The architecture integrates a fully pipelined EEG processing workflow, including signal preprocessing, FFT-based feature extraction, SVM-based inference, and confidence-aware adaptive learning. To support long-term deployment on implantable and edge BCI devices, OPTIMIND introduces an optimized memory hierarchy with feature caching, support-vector caching, predictive prefetching, and margin-based update filtering, significantly reducing unnecessary NVM writes while preserving accuracy.

OPTIMIND is evaluated using a Python-based system-level simulator on the EEGEmotions-27 dataset in a fully streaming configuration. Results demonstrate an average online classification accuracy of 81% with an end-to-end latency of 31.6 ms, while maintaining bounded model growth and low learning overhead. Compared to a baseline system without memory and learning optimizations, OPTIMIND achieves substantially lower latency and improved memory efficiency.
